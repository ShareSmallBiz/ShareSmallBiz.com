# Package Update Notes (2025-09-15)

## Summary

Updated `package.json` to better reflect the ShareSmallBiz Portal project, refresh dependencies, reduce supply chain surface, and add basic security/dependency maintenance scripts.

## Metadata Changes

- name: `web-spark-portal` → `sharesmallbiz-portal` (align with repo identity)
- version: `8.0.1` → `8.1.0` minor bump for dependency refresh
- engines: Added `node >=18.0.0` to codify supported runtime
- scripts: Added `security:audit`, `security:audit:fix`, `deps:check` for maintenance

## Dependency Changes

### Replaced

- `fontawesome-free` → `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@^6.6.0` (official, maintained package)

### Removed (Unused / Duplicates / Not wired)

- `terser` (not referenced by build scripts; `uglify-js` used instead)
- Duplicate `bootswatch` entry in dependencies (kept only as devDependency)
- `@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss` (not currently integrated into build pipeline)
- `clean-css-cli` (no script references; minification handled via cssnano)
- `dotenv` (not referenced in scripts or code paths inspected)

### Retained

Core build tooling: `sass`, `autoprefixer`, `cssnano`, `postcss`, `uglify-js`, `shelljs`, `upath`.

Front-end runtime libs needed for bundling: Bootstrap, DataTables family, jQuery, SignalR, Feather Icons, Trumbowyg, PrismJS, validation libs, jszip/pdfmake (DataTables export features).

## Risk / Security Rationale

- Removing unused packages lowers transitive dependency count, reducing attack surface.
- Replacing unofficial Font Awesome wrapper with official package ensures timely security/content updates.
- Adding audit scripts enables quick vulnerability checks in CI or local.

## Follow-Up Suggestions

1. Consider adding a purge step (PostCSS + PurgeCSS or lightningcss) if final CSS size is a concern.
2. Evaluate moving some runtime libs to devDependencies if you later vendor/lock compiled assets and do not require those libs at runtime in production hosting environment.
3. Add a LICENSE file and update `license` field with an SPDX identifier (e.g., MIT) if appropriate.
4. Optionally add `files` array to restrict published artifact scope if this is ever published to npm (currently seems internal).

## Verification Steps (Pending)

- Run `npm install` to materialize new lock graph.
- Execute `npm run build` ensure Font Awesome path updates not required (SCSS imports use `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free`? Need to adjust import if build fails. Current SCSS imports `fontawesome-free/css/all`; may need change to `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all`.)

If build fails for Font Awesome import, update import line in `src/scss/core/styles.scss` accordingly.

## Phase 2 (Post Manual Edit Remediation)

After a manual change set (Font Awesome version bumped to `^7.0.1`), the build began failing during the `build:assets` step with:

```text
Error: Cannot find module 'glob'
    at Module._resolveFilename ... (require stack: scripts/render-assets.js)
```

### Root Causes

1. `glob` package required in `scripts/render-assets.js` was never declared in dependencies/devDependencies.
2. The Font Awesome webfonts copy path inside `scripts/render-assets.js` still referenced legacy `fontawesome-free` directory instead of the scoped `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free` package path introduced earlier.

### Fixes Applied

- Added dev dependency: `"glob": "^11.0.0"`.
- Updated Font Awesome fonts path in `scripts/render-assets.js` to `../node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/webfonts`.
- Previously (Phase 1) updated SCSS import to `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all` (confirmed still valid with v7.0.1).

### Validation

Executed full pipeline: `npm run build`.

Results:

- SCSS compiled successfully (only Sass deprecation warnings re: `@import`, `darken()`, `fade-out()`—non-blocking).
- JS minification succeeded (UglifyJS output present).
- Assets step completed—Font Awesome webfonts, Feather icons, Bootstrap icons, Trumbowyg assets, jQuery validation scripts all copied into `wwwroot/dist` folders.
- No missing module errors remain.

### Outstanding (Non-Blocking) Items

- Sass deprecation warnings indicate future migration path:
  - Replace legacy `@import` with `@use`/`@forward`.
  - Refactor color helpers: use `color.scale()` or `color.adjust()` instead of `darken()` / `fade-out()`.
- 1 low severity vulnerability reported by `npm audit` (left unresolved; acceptable risk short-term—run `npm run security:audit` to review and optionally `npm run security:audit:fix`).

### Suggested Next Steps (Optional)

1. Create a separate refactor branch for Sass modernization to avoid mixing semantic changes with dependency hygiene.
2. Introduce a small helper (e.g., `scripts/config/paths.js`) to centralize third-party asset paths, reducing future churn risk when package names/versions change.
3. Add a CI job to run: `npm ci && npm run build && npm run security:audit` to catch regressions early.
